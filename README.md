Trying to implement a GameBoy emulator in Rust. The goal is to have [100% accuracy with the original hardware](https://mgba.io/2017/04/30/emulation-accuracy).

Along with the project [I'm preparing a page](https://oscarcpozas.github.io/gb_emu) with the operation of each of the pieces and notes with interesting aspects that I've encountered along the way. (Because my native language is **Spanish**, these notes are in this language)
